# URBANopt Modelica Edition

This is the repository for things related to the Modelica version of URBANopt.
There are two primary purposes for this repository.

1. The development team will use one or more GitHub project boards to track progress,
https://github.com/NREL/URBANopt-Modelica/projects.

2. Software that is "glue code" should be committed here. On the other hand,
Modelica models should be located in Modelica Buildings Library,
https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings/tree/issue1437_district_energy_system/Buildings/DistrictEnergySystem.
